        The Open for UN SDG Conference on September 13, 2025, will feature a full-day program uniting 
        thought leaders, practitioners, and innovators. Each thematic session will open with expert 
        insights and transition into interactive open discussions, fostering dialogue on how open 
        technologies can drive progress toward the UN Sustainable Development Goals.
        <br/><br/>
        The conference will follow the Chatham House Rule and produce a white paper capturing key 
        takeaways and action items. We aim to identify impactful collaborative projects and present 
        a progress report at the 2026 UN OSPOS for Good conference at the UN Headquarters in New York.

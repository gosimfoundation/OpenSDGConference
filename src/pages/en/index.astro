        The Open for UN SDG Conference brings together UN leaders, open source communities, 
        standards organizations, technologists, academic and research experts, and public and 
        private sector innovators to tackle global challenges. Together, we explore how open 
        collaboration can drive progress on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 
        (SDGs)—from climate action to digital inclusion. This is a call to co-create open 
        source solutions with an AI focus, build global collaboration, and turn shared vision 
        into action.

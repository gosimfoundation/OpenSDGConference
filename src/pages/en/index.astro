Open-source projects – ranging from software and data sets to artificial intelligence models, standards and content – form the backbone of what the UN calls digital public goods. These shared resources unlock innovation and equity by allowing anyone to build upon and localize proven technologies. The Office for Digital and Emerging Technologies notes that investing in open-source software, open data, open AI models, open standards and open content is key to achieving the SDGs."
